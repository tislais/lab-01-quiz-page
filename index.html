                </h1>

                <p>
                    A <strong>twisty puzzle</strong>, also known as a <strong>combination puzzle</strong> or <strong>sequential move puzzle</strong>, is a puzzle which consists of a set of pieces which can be manipulated by twists into different combinations by a group of operations. Many such puzzles are of a polyhedral shape, and consist of multiple layers of pieces along many axes which can rotate independently of each other. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The most famous of these puzzles is the original <strong>Rubik's Cube</strong>, a 3x3x3 cubic puzzle in which each of the <strong>six faces</strong> can be independently rotated. Each of the six faces is a different colour, but each of the nine pieces on a face is identical in colour, in the solved condition. 
                </p>
                <p>Fun facts about the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There are 21 pieces total: a single core piece consisting of three intersecting axes holding the six centre squares in place but letting them rotate, and 20 smaller pieces (8 corner pieces and 12 edge pieces) which fit into it to form the assembled puzzle.</li>
                    <li>The center square of each of the six faces is merely a single square façade that spins; all six are affixed to the core mechanism. Since it never moves, the center cubie represents which color that side should solve to.</li>
                    <li>The cube can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by rotating the top layer by 45° and then prying one of its edge pieces away from the other two layers.</li>
                    <li>It is much faster to solve a cube by taking it apart and reassembling than it is to reposition stickers.</li>
                    <li>There are 43 quintillion possible permutations that be reached by turning the sides of the cube.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Regular Cuboids</h3>
                <p>A regular cuboid is a cuboid puzzle where all the pieces are the same size in edge length. Pieces are often referred to as "cubies".</p>

                <h3>Irregular Cuboids</h3>
                <p>An irregular cuboid is a cuboid puzzle where not all the pieces are the same size in edge length. This category of puzzle is often made by taking a larger regular cuboid puzzle and fusing together some of the pieces to make larger pieces. Puzzles which are constructed in this way are often called "bandaged" cubes. However, there are many irregular cuboids that have not (and often could not) be made by bandaging. Irregular cuboids can morph their shape while scrambled but return to the cube shape when solved. My personal favorite irregular cuboid is the <strong>Square-1</strong> puzzle.

                <h3>Polyhedra puzzles</h3>
                <p>Twisty puzzles that never solve into a cube shape fall under this category. This includes the <strong>Pyraminx</strong> (a tetrahedral-shaped puzzle with axes on the corners and trivial tips), the <strong>Megaminx</strong> (a 12-sided polyhedron puzzle similar to Rubik's Cube in operation and solution), and the <strong>Dogic</strong> (an icosahedron cut into 60 triangular pieces around its 12 tips and 20 face centers).
                </p>

                <h3>Other Types of Puzzles</h3>
                <p>
                    Other types of twisty puzzles exist including circular puzzles, non-Rubik style three-dimentional puzzles, and geared puzzles. Examples include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Magic Ball</strong> - Also known as Rubik's Sphere. Mechanically identical to the 3×3×3 cube in operation and solution. </li>
                    <li><strong>Snake Cube</strong> - The cubelets are connected by an elastic band running through them. They can rotate freely. The aim of the puzzle is to arrange the chain in such a way that they will form 3 x 3 x 3 or 4 x 4 x 4 cube.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gear Cube</strong> - This twisty puzzle was invented by Oskar van Deventer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Side note: there are puzzles related to all of the above but don't count as twisty puzzles because they are two-dimentional. Here are some examples of those:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fifteen puzzle</strong> - The original sliding piece puzzle. </li>
                    <li><strong>Rubik's Magic</strong> - Not entirely 2D. Involves flipping parts back onto itself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Klotski</strong> - A traditional sliding piece puzzle. There are now endless variations of this original puzzle implemented as computer games.</li>
                </ol>
